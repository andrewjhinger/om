        Dan had found the perfect ring for Serina, but it took him three weeks
        to figure out a good way to propose to her.  He decided a nice home made,
        candle-lit dinner on the roof of their apartment would be an amazing way to go.
        Serina had a work trip planned and he could have dinner ready by the time she
        got home!
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately for Dan, the Chicago winter had come sooner than expected.
        Chicago winters make for poor roof-top dinners. He decided that he didn't want
        to wait until spring, so an indoor setting would have to do. Also unfortunately
        for Dan, he has very poor cooking skills and Serina has amazing food
        appreciation and tasting skills. He decided take-out sushi and an apartment
        filled with over 50 candles would be the best plan for the proposal.
    </p>

    <p>
        Serina told Dan that she'd be home at 8pm. He got off work at 3pm to prepare.
        Unfortunately for Dan, Serina's flight got in much earlier than expected and he
        had far less time than anticipated to finish. Also unfortuante, is that it takes
        a surprising amount of time to light 50 candles! Serina surprised Dan by texting
        him that she was 5 minutes away from home when he wasn't even close to being
        ready. For a minute he froze and wasn't sure how to handle the situation. He
        hadn't even found time to pick up the sushi. So, he came up with a brilliant
        plan to have Serina get the Sushi! She loves sushi so this should be no problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        Serina was very excited to get home and relax, and was slightly perturbed when
        Dan asked her to go directly to the sushi restaurant and pick up sushi...  as
        well as order it. At this point she knew something was up, so she played along.
    </p>

    <p>
        Serina's trip to the restaurant gave Dan enough time to finish his preparations.
        When she got to the apartment there were love notes waiting for her leading
        her all around the candle-filled place and eventually to the bedroom where Dan
        was waiting on one knee.
    </p>

    <p>
        She proclaimed - "I KNEW IT!". And then she let Dan go on to say some nice
        things about their relationship and officially pop the question. Fortunately for
        Dan, she said yes!

                Dan knew Serina was the one long before he even moved to Chicago for her. But now he felt that it was time to make it official.
            </p>
            <p>
                A few months earlier Serina had told Dan that she would feel bad about receiving a "blood diamond", and would prefer something that was conflict free. She also told him the exact style of diamond and band that she preferred. Armed with all this information, it was going to be difficult for Dan to screw this up. He took his time to find the perfect diamond though, and can thank the great people at <a href="http://www.brilliantearth.com/"> Brilliant Earth</a> for helping him out.

                Serina earned an exciting job opportunity within PepsiCo to transfer to R&D in Barrington, IL. Being the independent career woman that she is, she was for sure going to take this job. She cared a lot aboud Dan but wouldn't dream of pressuring him to drop everything and move to IL for her. She  told him that he could come if he wanted, but it'd be totally up to him. Dan had never even been to Chicago, but he had a really great feeling about Serina, and decided it would be definitely worth it to move there with her. He wanted to a new job anyway, so this was a perfect opportunity to jump into something new. They decided to live in the city because of all the great things they'd heard about it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Serina & Dan love Chicago and are both extremely happy to be there. They do hope to move back to CA some day, but are in no hurry to do so.
